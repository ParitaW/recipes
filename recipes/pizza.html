    <p>Pizza is a beloved Italian dish that has become a global culinary phenomenon. It consists of a flattened disk of bread dough topped with some combination of olive oil, oregano, tomato, olives, mozzarella or other cheese, and many other ingredients, baked quickly—usually, in a commercial setting, using a wood-fired oven heated to a very high temperature—and served hot. Originally from Naples, Italy, pizza has evolved into countless variations worldwide, from traditional Neapolitan styles to modern interpretations. It's celebrated for its versatility, making it perfect for everything from casual dining to special occasions.</p>
