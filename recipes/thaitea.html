    <p>Thai tea is a beloved traditional beverage from Thailand, known for its distinctive orange color and rich, creamy
        taste. This sweet and refreshing drink is made from strongly-brewed Ceylon tea, flavored with star anise,
        crushed tamarind, and other spices. It's traditionally served over ice and topped with evaporated milk or
        coconut milk, creating a beautiful layered effect. Popular both in Thailand and internationally, it's the
        perfect complement to spicy Thai dishes or enjoyed on its own as a refreshing treat.</p>
